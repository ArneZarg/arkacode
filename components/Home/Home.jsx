                                            "Not too long ago, I approached Arne to help me build a website for my fatherâ€™s business. I had absolutely no idea about what needed to be done and the actual work that goes into it. Nonetheless, Arne was a huge help from beginning to end and turned the entire process into a smooth enjoyable experience!  He sat down with me and helped me every step of the way. He picked my brain about the company, bounced ideas off of me, and practically designed the website as well. After this phase, he began development on the website. I have to say, the turnaround time on the site was incredible. Within a few days he had finished the site, and all that was left was for me to fill in the content. In additional to all of this, the website ended up being fantastic, and both my father and I are extremely satisfied. To sum it up: Arne was top notch from beginning to end, and I 100% recommend him to everyone!"
